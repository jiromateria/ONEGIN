Will play the tyrants to the very same,
To hideous winter and confounds him there,.
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
For never-resting time leads summer on
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
O that you were your self! but, love, you are
No longer yours than you yourself here live;
Against this coming end you should prepare,
And your sweet semblance to some other give:
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination; then you were
Your self again after yourself's decease,
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
O, none but unthrifts: dear my love, you know
You had a father, let your son say so.
Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filled with your most high deserts?
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
The age to come would say, 'This poet lies;
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.'
So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage
And stretchd metre of an ntique song:
But were some child of yours alive that time,
You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
    
   
    
    
     
                                               
                                                                        
                                                                
And, constant stars*, in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert:
Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO

BERNARDO

Who's there?

FRANCISCO

Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO

Long live the king!

FRANCISCO

Bernardo?

BERNARDO

He.

FRANCISCO

You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO

'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO

For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.

BERNARDO

Have you had quiet guard?

FRANCISCO

Not a mouse stirring.

BERNARDO

Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

FRANCISCO

I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?

Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO

Friends to this ground.

MARCELLUS

And liegemen to the Dane.

FRANCISCO

Give you good night.

MARCELLUS

O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?

FRANCISCO

Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.

Exit

MARCELLUS

Holla! Bernardo!

BERNARDO

Say,
What, is Horatio there?

HORATIO

A piece of him.

BERNARDO

Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

MARCELLUS

What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

BERNARDO

I have seen nothing.

MARCELLUS

Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

HORATIO

Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

BERNARDO

Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO

Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

BERNARDO

Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--

Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS

Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!

BERNARDO

In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

MARCELLUS

Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

BERNARDO

Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.

HORATIO

Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.

BERNARDO

It would be spoke to.

MARCELLUS

Question it, Horatio.

HORATIO

What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!

MARCELLUS

It is offended.

BERNARDO

See, it stalks away!

HORATIO

Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!

Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS

'Tis gone, and will not answer.

BERNARDO

How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?

HORATIO

Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.

MARCELLUS

Is it not like the king?

HORATIO

As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.

MARCELLUS

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

HORATIO

In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

MARCELLUS

Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?

HORATIO

That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

BERNARDO

I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.

HORATIO

A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!

Re-enter Ghost

I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:

Cock crows

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

MARCELLUS

Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

HORATIO

Do, if it will not stand.

BERNARDO

'Tis here!

HORATIO

'Tis here!

MARCELLUS

'Tis gone!

Exit Ghost

We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.

BERNARDO

It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

HORATIO

And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.

MARCELLUS

It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

HORATIO

So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

MARCELLUS

Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.

Exeunt

A room of state in the castle.

Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants

KING CLAUDIUS

Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

CORNELIUS, VOLTIMAND

In that and all things will we show our duty.

KING CLAUDIUS

We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

LAERTES

My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

KING CLAUDIUS

Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

LORD POLONIUS

He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

KING CLAUDIUS

Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--

HAMLET

[Aside]

A little more than kin, and less than kind.

KING CLAUDIUS

How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

HAMLET

Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.

HAMLET

Ay, madam, it is common.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?

HAMLET

Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'

His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
As if increase of appetite had grown
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
Well, sit we down,
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
If it assume my noble father's person,
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
For never-resting time leads summer on
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
Ay, madam, it is common.
For what we know must be and is as common
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Shall in the general censure take corruption
So horridly to shake our disposition
Why should we in our peevish opposition
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Look, with what courteous action
And they in France of the best rank and station
The very place puts toys of desperation,
To show my duty in your coronation,
He waxes desperate with imagination.
This present object made probation.
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
In honourable fashion.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
Such was the very armour he had on
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
To his confine: and of the truth herein
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
Without more motive, into every brain
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
Perchance 'twill walk again.
I shall not look upon his like again.
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
So, oft it chances in particular men,
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
What we have two nights seen.
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
The platform.
And there assume some other horrible form,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In filial obligation for some term
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
Is it a custom?
And to the manner born, it is a custom
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Nay, let's follow him.
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
A piece of him.
And will not let belief take hold of him
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
The inward service of the mind and soul
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
I warrant it will.
It waves me still.
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
I am glad to see you well:
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
Or say with princes if it shall go well
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Farewell.
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
He was a man, take him for all in all,
Last night of all,
All
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
To his own scandal.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
And with a larger tether may he walk
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
No, it is struck.
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
That can I;
What is between you? give me up the truth.
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
For he himself is subject to his birth:
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
And hears it roar beneath.
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
Without the sensible and true avouch
Why this same strict and most observant watch
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
Appears before them, and with solemn march
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
Believe so much in him, that he is young
And stretchd metre of an ntique song:
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
Therefore I have entreated him along
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Not a mouse stirring.
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
Long live the king!
Is it not like the king?
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
And then it started like a guilty thing
I have seen nothing.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
As thou art to thyself:
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
And with no less nobility of love
I think it lacks of twelve.
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
No longer yours than you yourself here live;
And your sweet semblance to some other give:
Before my God, I might not this believe
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
As of a father: for let the world take note,
As it doth well appear unto our state--
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
The safety and health of this whole state;
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
A room in Polonius' house.
In obstinate condolement is a course
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Your self again after yourself's decease,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
Think it no more;
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
As if it some impartment did desire
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Find no determination; then you were
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Who's there?
What, is Horatio there?
I would I had been there.
To hideous winter and confounds him there,.
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
But to my mind, though I am native here
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
O that you were your self! but, love, you are
Against this coming end you should prepare,
To business with the king, more than the scope
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
From top to toe?
You are the most immediate to our throne;
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
To you alone.
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
'Tis gone!
The bell then beating one,--
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
If there be any good thing to be done,
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And liegemen to the Dane.
You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Of his affection to me.
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
Have after. To what issue will this come?
Who will believe my verse in time to come
That if again this apparition come,
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
Who is't that can inform me?
But were some child of yours alive that time,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Will play the tyrants to the very same,
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
A room of state in the castle.
Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Season your admiration for awhile
Sit down awhile;
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
Nay, very pale.
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
These hands are not more like.
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
'Tis very strange.
'Tis strange.
The triumph of his pledge.
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage
So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
Why seems it so particular with thee?
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;

[Aside]
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
And recks not his own rede.
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
To offer it the show of violence;
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Your leave and favour to return to France;
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
A double blessing is a double grace,
Bernardo has my place.
As he in his particular act and place
Then saw you not his face?
If it be,
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
He.
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
I shall obey, my lord.
Do not, my lord.
You shall not go, my lord.
We do, my lord.
What does this mean, my lord?
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Where, my lord?
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
A truant disposition, good my lord.
Arm'd, my lord.
My good lord--
My dread lord,
A sable silver'd.
Have you had quiet guard?
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
Friends to this ground.
It waves you to a more removed ground:
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
A little more than kin, and less than kind.
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
And carriage of the article design'd,
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
Do, if it will not stand.
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
CORNELIUS, VOLTIMAND
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
But to recover of us, by strong hand
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
My lord, I did;
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
Pale or red?
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
It is offended.
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
