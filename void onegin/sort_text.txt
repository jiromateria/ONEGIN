Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
In that and all things will we show our duty.
And we did think it writ down in our duty
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Passing through nature to eternity.
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Is not this something more than fantasy?
That are so fortified against our story
And these few precepts in thy memory
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Most constantly.
You do not understand yourself so clearly
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
What, look'd he frowningly?
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
And makes each petty artery in this body
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
See, it stalks away!
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
For they are actions that a man might play:
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
Say,
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
What hour now?
O, none but unthrifts: dear my love, you know
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Of these delated articles allow.
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But I have that within which passeth show;
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
Arm'd, say you?
I'll visit you.
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
This marvel to you.
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
What I have said to you.
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
But let me hear from you.
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
It would have much amazed you.
Who hath relieved you?
Not when I saw't.
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
My fate cries out,
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
Exit Ghost
Exit Ghost
Re-enter Ghost
Enter Ghost

Ay, marry, is't:
This heavy-headed revel east and west
By laboursome petition, and at last
To make it truster of your own report
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert:
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
And, constant stars*, in them I read such art
And I am sick at heart.
The head is not more native to the heart,
My lord, from head to foot.
In what particular thought to work I know not;
O, fear me not.
Exeunt

What think you on't?
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Against the which, a moiety competent
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Exit

It will not speak; then I will follow it.
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
Heaven will direct it.
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Did you not speak to it?
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
It beckons you to go away with it,
But do not go with it.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
To let you know of it.
And draw you into madness? think of it:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
But answer made it none: yet once methought
Marry, well bethought:
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
And vanish'd from our sight.
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
I will watch to-night;
Hold you the watch to-night?
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Give you good night.
Give you good night.
Well, good night.
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
Exeunt all but HAMLET
Exeunt all but HAMLET
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Ghost beckons HAMLET
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Do you doubt that?
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
Cock crows
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,

Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
If it were filled with your most high deserts?
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
It lifted up its head and did address
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
That was and is the question of these wars.
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
And let us once again assail your ears,
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Is the main motive of our preparations,
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
No, by no means.
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
But where was this?
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
Of mine own eyes.
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

As harbingers preceding still the fates
Look, my lord, it comes!
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The age to come would say, 'This poet lies;
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.'
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Importing the surrender of those lands
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
Hold off your hands.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Our duty to your honour.
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
You come most carefully upon your hour.
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
It is a nipping and an eager air.
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
Giving to you no further personal power
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
O, farewell, honest soldier:
May give his saying deed; which is no further
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
The king my father!
My father's brother, but no more like my father
My father!--methinks I see my father.
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
To give these mourning duties to your father:
My lord, the king your father.
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
Longer, longer.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
For God's love, let me hear.
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Why, what should be the fear?
Why, what should be the fear?
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
Hail to your lordship!
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
It would be spoke to.
I would not hear your enemy say so,
You had a father, let your son say so.
No more but so?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
I do no                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          His beard was grizzled--no?
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Question it, Horatio.
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
As if increase of appetite had grown
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
Well, sit we down,
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
If it assume my noble father's person,
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
For never-resting time leads summer on
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
Ay, madam, it is common.
For what we know must be and is as common
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Shall in the general censure take corruption
So horridly to shake our disposition
Why should we in our peevish opposition
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Look, with what courteous action
And they in France of the best rank and station
The very place puts toys of desperation,
To show my duty in your coronation,
He waxes desperate with imagination.
This present object made probation.
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
In honourable fashion.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
Such was the very armour he had on
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
To his confine: and of the truth herein
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
Without more motive, into every brain
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
Perchance 'twill walk again.
I shall not look upon his like again.
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
So, oft it chances in particular men,
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
What we have two nights seen.
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
The platform.
And there assume some other horrible form,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In filial obligation for some term
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
Is it a custom?
And to the manner born, it is a custom
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Nay, let's follow him.
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
A piece of him.
And will not let belief take hold of him
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
The inward service of the mind and soul
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
I warrant it will.
It waves me still.
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
I am glad to see you well:
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
Or say with princes if it shall go well
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Farewell.
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
He was a man, take him for all in all,
Last night of all,
All
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
To his own scandal.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
And with a larger tether may he walk
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
No, it is struck.
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
That can I;
What is between you? give me up the truth.
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
For he himself is subject to his birth:
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
And hears it roar beneath.
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
Without the sensible and true avouch
Why this same strict and most observant watch
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
Appears before them, and with solemn march
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
Believe so much in him, that he is young
And stretchd metre of an ntique song:
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
Therefore I have entreated him along
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Not a mouse stirring.
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
Long live the king!
Is it not like the king?
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
And then it started like a guilty thing
I have seen nothing.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
As thou art to thyself:
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
And with no less nobility of love
I think it lacks of twelve.
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
No longer yours than you yourself here live;
And your sweet semblance to some other give:
Before my God, I might not this believe
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
As of a father: for let the world take note,
As it doth well appear unto our state--
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
The safety and health of this whole state;
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
A room in Polonius' house.
In obstinate condolement is a course
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Your self again after yourself's decease,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
Think it no more;
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
As if it some impartment did desire
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Find no determination; then you were
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Who's there?
What, is Horatio there?
I would I had been there.
To hideous winter and confounds him there,.
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
But to my mind, though I am native here
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
O that you were your self! but, love, you are
Against this coming end you should prepare,
To business with the king, more than the scope
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
From top to toe?
You are the most immediate to our throne;
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
To you alone.
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
'Tis gone!
The bell then beating one,--
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
If there be any good thing to be done,
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And liegemen to the Dane.
You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Of his affection to me.
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
Have after. To what issue will this come?
Who will believe my verse in time to come
That if again this apparition come,
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
Who is't that can inform me?
But were some child of yours alive that time,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Will play the tyrants to the very same,
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
A room of state in the castle.
Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Season your admiration for awhile
Sit down awhile;
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
Nay, very pale.
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
These hands are not more like.
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
'Tis very strange.
'Tis strange.
The triumph of his pledge.
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage
So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
Why seems it so particular with thee?
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
QUEEN GERTRUDE
QUEEN GERTRUDE
QUEEN GERTRUDE
[Aside]
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
And recks not his own rede.
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
To offer it the show of violence;
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Your leave and favour to return to France;
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
A double blessing is a double grace,
Bernardo has my place.
As he in his particular act and place
Then saw you not his face?
If it be,
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
He.
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
I shall obey, my lord.
Do not, my lord.
You shall not go, my lord.
We do, my lord.
What does this mean, my lord?
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Where, my lord?
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
A truant disposition, good my lord.
Arm'd, my lord.
My good lord--
My dread lord,
A sable silver'd.
Have you had quiet guard?
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
Friends to this ground.
It waves you to a more removed ground:
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
A little more than kin, and less than kind.
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
And carriage of the article design'd,
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
Do, if it will not stand.
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
CORNELIUS, VOLTIMAND
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
But to recover of us, by strong hand
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
My lord, I did;
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
Pale or red?
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
It is offended.
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
OPHELIA
